This analysis explores key audio features—danceability, energy, loudness, and valence—to identify trends in Spotify's most streamed songs. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values and categorizing songs by energy and danceability levels for structured comparisons.

Visualizations, including bar charts and word clouds, highlight patterns in popular music. The findings help identify which characteristics contribute to a song’s success, providing insights for artists, producers, and music analysts.
